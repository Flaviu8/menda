                <h2>üõ†Ô∏è How Our Containerized System Works</h2>
                <p>Our cloud platform uses a container-based architecture to ensure scalability, security, and high availability. Here‚Äôs how the system functions:</p>

                   <p> 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Uploads a File <br/>
                    The system assigns a unique ID to ensure privacy. <br/> 
                    The file is uploaded to a temporary processing queue. </p>
                    
                    <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ Container-Based Processing </br>
                    A dedicated batch processing system picks up the file.</br>
                    The file is analyzed and categorized based on type, size, and user access permissions. </br>
                    It is then moved into a secure containerized storage with proper metadata.</p>
                    
                    <p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Data Retrieval </br>
                    Users can access, share, or retrieve files instantly through API endpoints or dashboard. </br>
                    If a file is requested frequently, our caching system speeds up retrieval.</p>
                    
                    <p>4Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Maintenance & Cleanup </br>
                    Our system runs scheduled batch jobs to clean up old or unused files, freeing up storage space. </br>
                    Users receive alerts for files approaching expiration or storage limits.</p>
                    
                    <p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Security & Privacy First </br>
                    Files are encrypted and only accessible to authorized users.</br>
                    Each storage container is isolated from others to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
